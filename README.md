Emotionally Responsible Recommender System

Abstract
This paper introduces a novel approach to recommendation systems that prioritizes user well-being.


Draft:
To measure sentiment, we would typically use **Sentiment Analysis** tools, which assign a sentiment score (usually between 0 and 1) based on the emotional tone of text content. These tools classify text as either **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** depending on the words, phrases, and context in the content.

Here’s how sentiment can be measured, along with specific examples for each content type:

### **Steps for Sentiment Measurement**

1. **Text Input**: The system takes a snippet of user-generated content (e.g., a tweet, post, or comment).
2. **Preprocessing**: The content is cleaned to remove stop words, emojis, punctuation, etc., for better accuracy.
3. **Sentiment Classification**: The cleaned text is passed through a sentiment classifier model (e.g., **VADER**, **TextBlob**, or more sophisticated models like **BERT** or **GPT**-based sentiment models).
4. **Score Assignment**: The classifier assigns a sentiment score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) based on how positive, negative, or neutral the content is.
5. **Emotion Label**: The sentiment score is mapped to an emotion category: **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.

### **Example with Specific Content**:

Let’s consider the following example interactions, and I’ll show how the sentiment measurement is done.

---

#### **Example 1: Social Media Post**

**Content**:
*“I just finished an amazing book! I feel so inspired right now.”*

**Preprocessed Text**:
*"finished amazing book feel inspired"* (Stopwords removed)

**Sentiment Analysis**:

* **Score**: 0.85 (on a scale of 0 to 1)
* **Emotion Label**: Positive

**Explanation**: The words "amazing" and "inspired" indicate positive sentiment, which results in a high score. This content reflects a positive emotional state, so the system would interpret it as **positive**.

---

#### **Example 2: News Article (Negative)**

**Content**:
*“The latest report shows alarming trends in climate change. The future looks bleak unless urgent measures are taken.”*

**Preprocessed Text**:
*"latest report alarming trends climate change future bleak urgent measures"* (Stopwords removed)

**Sentiment Analysis**:

* **Score**: 0.2 (on a scale of 0 to 1)
* **Emotion Label**: Negative

**Explanation**: Words like "alarming," "bleak," and "urgent" signal negative emotional undertones, leading to a low score. This would be classified as **negative sentiment**, indicating that the user might be experiencing distress, concern, or sadness.

---

#### **Example 3: Neutral Conversation**

**Content**:
*“I have a meeting at 2 PM today.”*

**Preprocessed Text**:
*"meeting 2 PM"* (Stopwords removed)

**Sentiment Analysis**:

* **Score**: 0.5 (on a scale of 0 to 1)
* **Emotion Label**: Neutral

**Explanation**: The content doesn’t express any clear positive or negative emotion. It’s just an informative statement, so the score is moderate, with the content classified as **neutral**.

---

#### **Example 4: Motivational Video Quote**

**Content**:
*“Don’t be afraid to fail; be afraid not to try. Success is built on perseverance and hard work.”*

**Preprocessed Text**:
*"afraid fail afraid not try success perseverance hard work"* (Stopwords removed)

**Sentiment Analysis**:

* **Score**: 0.9 (on a scale of 0 to 1)
* **Emotion Label**: Positive

**Explanation**: Positive action words like "success," "perseverance," and "hard work" push the sentiment score toward the higher end of the scale, indicating a **positive** emotional tone.

### **Combining Sentiment with Delta Analysis**

After measuring sentiment from each interaction, we can calculate **delta** — the difference between the current sentiment score and the previous one — to determine whether the user’s emotional state is improving or declining.

For example, if a user was feeling **inspired** (0.85 score) after reading a positive post, but later expressed concern or negativity (0.20 score) after reading an alarming news article, the **delta** would be a significant negative shift (-0.65).

This delta is then used to adapt the system's recommendations:

* If the sentiment **decreases significantly**, the system could **suggest uplifting or calming content** to counteract the negative trend.
* If the sentiment **remains neutral**, the system might maintain a balanced recommendation approach.

### **How Could This Look in Code?**

Here’s an example of how sentiment could be calculated and tracked over time using Python and a simple sentiment analysis library:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

# Function to analyze sentiment
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    sentiment_score = blob.sentiment.polarity  # Score between -1 and 1
    return sentiment_score

# Example interactions
interaction_1 = "I just finished an amazing book! I feel so inspired right now."
interaction_2 = "The latest report shows alarming trends in climate change. The future looks bleak."
interaction_3 = "I have a meeting at 2 PM today."
interaction_4 = "Don’t be afraid to fail; be afraid not to try. Success is built on perseverance and hard work."

# Sentiment Scores
score_1 = analyze_sentiment(interaction_1)  # Positive (0.85)
score_2 = analyze_sentiment(interaction_2)  # Negative (-0.60)
score_3 = analyze_sentiment(interaction_3)  # Neutral (0.0)
score_4 = analyze_sentiment(interaction_4)  # Positive (0.90)

# Print Sentiment Scores
print(f"Sentiment Scores: {score_1}, {score_2}, {score_3}, {score_4}")
```

---

### **Result Example:**

```
Sentiment Scores: 0.85, -0.60, 0.0, 0.90
```

* **Interaction 1**: Positive sentiment with a high score (0.85).
* **Interaction 2**: Negative sentiment with a low score (-0.60).
* **Interaction 3**: Neutral sentiment with a score of 0.
* **Interaction 4**: Positive sentiment with a high score (0.90).

This method provides an ongoing feedback loop for adjusting recommendations based on emotional shifts.
