### ✨ Abstract

Most modern recommender systems optimize engagement without explicitly considering the emotional state of users. Here, we propose a pioneering model that measures, learns from, and optimizes emotional transitions between interaction sessions on social platforms (e.g., Twitter), with the explicit goal of enhancing user well-being.

---

### 📊 Background

Social media platforms significantly influence the mood and emotional stability of users. Yet current models:

* Encourage polarizing or anxiety-inducing content
* Lack mechanisms for emotional regulation
* Ignore the link between **session end states** and **subsequent session entry points**

---

###  Proposed Model

**Data Inputs:**

* NLP sentiment score for each interaction (tweet viewed, liked, commented)
* End-of-session score (average sentiment over last 5 content items seen)
* Start-of-next-session score (sentiment from first item viewed and reaction)
* Topic well-being relevance (measured by a curated scale)

**Key Metric:**
`Delta Sentiment = Sentiment_(t+1) − Sentiment_t`

**Recommendation weight =**
`0.6 × Delta Sentiment + 0.4 × WellBeingRelevance`

---

###  Feedback Loop

* If Delta Sentiment > 0 → content is positively reinforced
* If Delta Sentiment < 0 → content is deprioritized, replaced, or reframed with uplifting content

---

###  Twitter-Specific Application

* Emotion tracking over time
* Alternative feed mode: “Well-Being First Mode”
* Goal: reduce doomscrolling and emotional exhaustion

---

###  Potential Impact

* Breaks negative recommendation cycles
* Fosters emotional resilience
* Enables ethical, human-centered AI (Tech4Good)

---

###  Possible Extensions

* Biometric or behavioral signals (e.g., heart rate, fatigue)
* Journaling / self-reflection tools
* Public API for platform audit: *“Does this app improve your mood?”*

---

### ✨ Conclusion

It is both technically and ethically feasible to build recommender systems that support well-being. By connecting emotional session data with recommendation logic, we unlock the potential for emotionally intelligent digital platforms.
